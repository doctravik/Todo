## About TodoApp project
It's educational project. My attempt to create MVC application with pure PHP without any frameworks.

**Client section:**

- Guest can create a new user.
- Guest can create a new task for the selected user.
- Guest can attach photo to the created task.
- Guest can sort task by content, username, email, status.
- Task's list has pagination that considers sort attribute.

**Admin section:**

- Admin can edit task's content and mark task as completed.
- Admin can attach new photo to the task.
